# san-diego-home-price-prediction

## This project involved collecting data through web scrapping, cleaning and processing data, and training a regression model to predict the home price based on the apartment's neighborhood, square feet, and the number of beds and baths. Finally, the model was hosted on a web page.


### Steps:
- **BeautifulSoup** was used for web scrapping.
- Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection (**Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib**)
- Lasso model was implemented through grid search with a score of 83.7%. (**Python: scikit-learn**)
- The trained model was hosted through a **Flask** server for prediction (**HTMML/CSS**)
